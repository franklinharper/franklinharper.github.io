# Focusing on focus

I made a distraction free phone by removing all the apps that that I end up wasting time on. I still use my normal phone but only when it is necessary.

# Paris

Spending a month in the 13th arrondissemet of Paris. Mostly catching up with friends and family, visiting museums, and eating!

# Health

Fighting entropy with the goal to be pain free and active for as long as possible.
