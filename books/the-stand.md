# The Stand by Steven King

Should I avoid writing spoilers? Does Sivers take notes on fiction? How does he handle it?

## Summary

An epidemic almost entirely wipes out the human population. The few people that are left are alone. Everyone around them has died. Slowly individuals find each and form groups. Two leaders emerge. Both have the power to control the dreams of others. One leader is kind, humanistic, and favors democracy. The other is evil, and is a violent dictator. In the end one of the forces wins. But the victory isn't permanent because the leader of the losing force escapes at the last minute.

## My take

The characters are cartoonish and lack emotional depth. It irks me that there are super natural elements. The leaders, and some of the other characters can see the future, read the minds of others, inhabit the bodies of animals to see far away events, etc.
