Frank's NOW (24th of December 2025 update)

# Advent of Code 2025

I'm doing the [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) this year. It's a series of fun little Christmas themed coding challenges. The problems come out once a day in December. In general the problems get progressively harder. To make it more fun, there can be a social aspect by doing it with friends, having a leader board, sharing solutions, etc.

In previous years, I never finished all of the problems. But this year I have the goal of getting all the way to the end!

# Focusing on focus

For years I've been battling against distractions caused by my phone. And I finally have a solution that works!

It's the [Brick](https://getbrick.app/pages/story), and I love it! It's a hardware/software combo that allows me to selectively disable (aka brick) my distraction apps. A small piece of hardware is required to "unbrick" those apps, and that extra step adds just enough friction to prevent me from using the apps I want to avoid during certain times of the day. When running on Android 16 the Brick app isn't yet perfect. The automatic brick/unbrick scheduling doesn't always work, but hopefully they'll be able to fix that bug soon. The great thing is that since I have kicked my phone distraction habit, I don't even realize if the phone is bricked or not. My brain has learned new habits, and just assumes that I can't access the bricked apps when I have decided not to.

# Building apartments

I'm building 2 apartments in my backyard. They are going to be 2 x 1200 sq ft (110 sq meters). Construction started in December 2025, and should be finished by September 2026. Currently the existing garages are being demolished to make room for the new building.

# Back Pain

Applying the method described in the [Back Mechanic](https://a.co/d/fhumxke) book has been very effective!

While bending over picking something up off the floor, I experienced sudden back pain for the first time in my life! Luckily I had watched, Peter Attia's [interview of Stuart Mcgill](https://peterattiamd.com/stuartmcgill/). Mcgill's explanations and solutions made sense to me. So I bought his book, and followed his method for fixing back pain. The first step  is simple: identify movements that cause discomfort, and stop doing them!! I know that sounds obvious. But here's one example of what I was doing wrong: back stretches. I thought they were good for me, when they were contributing to my discomfort! Often doing less (e.g. stopping bad habits) is more effective than doing more. Of course that's only the first step in Mcgill's method. Buying, reading, and applying this book has been a great investment for me.
