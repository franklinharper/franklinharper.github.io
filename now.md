# Focusing on focus

I'm fighting a long running battle against procrastination and distraction.
My latest move was create a distraction free phone by removing all the apps that that I end up wasting time on. I still use my normal phone but only when it is necessary.

# Paris

Spending a month in the 13th arrondissemet of Paris. Mostly catching up with friends and family, visiting museums, and eating. A lot of eating! I'll go back to my normal healthier habits when I get back to LA

# Health

Fighting entropy with the goal to be pain free and active for as long as possible.
