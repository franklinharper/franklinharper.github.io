# Focusing on focus

I've been battling against phone distraction. And I finally have a solution that works!

It's the [Brick](https://getbrick.app/pages/story), and I love it! It is a hardware/app combo that allows me to selectively disable my distraction apps. The hardware is required to "unbrick" my phone, and adds just enough friction so that I'm not tempted to override the app blocking. It isn't perfect on Android, the automatic scheduling doesn't always work on Android 16, but hopefully they'll be able to fix that bug.

# Building apartments

I'm building 2 apartments in my LA backyard. It's 2 x 1200 sq ft (110 sq meters). Construction started in December 2025, and should be finished by September 2026. Currently the existing garages are being demolished to make room for the new building.

# Back Pain

Applying the methods described in the [Back Mechanic](https://a.co/d/fhumxke) book has been very effective!

While bending over picking something up off the floor, I experienced sudden back pain for the first time in my life! Luckily I had watched, Peter Attia's [interview of Stuart Mcgill](https://peterattiamd.com/stuartmcgill/). Mcgill's explanations were simple, and logical. So I bought his book, and followed his diagnostic method. The first step  is simple: identify movements that cause discomfort, and stop doing them!!1 I know that sounds obvious. But I was doing some back stretches, and thought they were good for me! Often doing less (e.g. stopping bad habits) is more effective than doing more. Of course that's just the first step. Buying, reading, and applying this book has been a great investment.
